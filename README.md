### Usage:
1. Upon loading of the Tierra Nueva Coffee Thins Locator landing page, the page will prompt the user to request current location. The map will center on the user's current location.
2. User inputs the address or zip code in which they want to search. 
3. User inputs the range of miles to perform search.
4. Site will provide list of Retailers, within the mileage range that carry Tierra Nueva Coffee thins.
5. List from the Retailers will provide the Retailer Name, Retailer Address, Products carried at location, Miles away & link to directions based on search parameters.
6. Google Maps side map will provide markers for each store location, numbered to correlate to the list.

### Future Enhancements:
1. On page load, geolocated location through the browser triggers the search automatically.
2. Store the last address/geocode searches so that the user can change the mileage parameter without reentering the location
3. Site design update to incorporate product images in the search.
4. Re-query the search results based on the zoom of the map and the visible boundaries. Allowing the user to drag the map to find more stores. (similar to Yelp).
